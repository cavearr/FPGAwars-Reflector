# FPGAwars Reflector

Reflector is a broadcast gateway that runs on browser and communicate serial UARTs with websocket, simple and powerful.

Initially designed for debugging purpouses but opens a new way to mix hardware and web technologies.

This software is part of the FPGAwars ecosystem

Now is very early version with many bugs and very little error control, we are experimenting with this new way os mix hardware and softare, soon we evolve this application.

The first objective of this app is connecting with LOVE FPGA blocks.

You can find some examples at this project.
